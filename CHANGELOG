v2.1
====

Bug fixes:
 - The rescaling of error spectrum was not working as intended, and was mostly just applying
   a constant factor to all the spectrum instead of having a wavelength dependence.
 - Fixed a bug with 'local_continuum' for lines that are partially or not covered.

New features:
 - The code can now output the adopted rescaling of the error spectrum.
 - The code will no longer accept spectra with missing CUNIT keywords
