v2.3
====

Bug fixes:
 - The model line profiles were incorrect when using the 'lsf_hdu' option, creating spurious
   negative wings.


v2.2
====

Bug fixes:
 - The continuum templates were interpolated rather than integrated within the spectral elements.
   This was only an issue when using data with very low spectral resolution.
 - Spectra with wavelength axis in log units and unit other than Hz or um weren't converted
   correctly.

New features:
 - Added the option 'lsf_hdu'. If set, this selects the FITS HDU from which to read the line spread
   function of the spectrum. This will be used to broaden the synthetic passband of each spectral
   element when fitting the models, using a gaussian of sigma equal to the specified value at each
   wavelength.


v2.1
====

Bug fixes:
 - The rescaling of error spectrum was not working as intended, and was mostly just applying
   a constant factor to all the spectrum instead of having a wavelength dependence.
 - Fixed a bug with 'local_continuum' for lines that are partially or not covered.

New features:
 - The code can now output the adopted rescaling of the error spectrum.
 - The code will no longer accept spectra with missing CUNIT keywords


v2.0
